### Budget Calculator

For my CPSC 210 project, I will be creating a budget calculator that will allow the user to track their spending 
and budget allowing for more conscientious spending habits.

### User Stories
- As a user, be able to add expenses to a list of expenses 
- As a user, be able to date their expenses (either automatically or by input)
- As a user, view all of their expenses within a specific day, month, or year. 

// 

- As a user, create categories for expenses (ie. groceries, restaurant, entertainment)
- As a user, view how much you've spent for each category
