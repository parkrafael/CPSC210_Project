### Budget Calculator

For my CPSC 210 project, I will be creating a budget calculator that will allow the user to track their spending 
and budget allowing for more conscientious spending habits.

### User Stories
- As a user, add expenses (with the date of purchase attached) to a list of expenses 
- As a user, view all of their expenses within a month
- As a user, be able to add their income 
- As a user, create categories for expenses (ie. groceries, restaurant, entertainment)
- As a user, view how much you've spent for each category
- As a user, view how much you've spent in total 
- As a user, view how much money you have remaining
