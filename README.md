### Budget Calculator

For my CPSC 210 project, I will be creating a budget calculator that will allow the user to track their spending 
and budget allowing for more conscientious spending habits.

### User Stories
- As a user, be able to add expenses to a list of expenses 
- As a user, be able to date when the expense was made
- As a user, be able to create names for expenses (ie. groceries, restaurant, entertainment)
- As a user, be able to view the total expenses within a specific day, month, year, or name.

extra (for the future):
- add statistical charts...
